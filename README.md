# DATA ANALYST INTERNAL BUSINESS CASE 📊

## Disclaimer ⚠️
The data used in this Business Case is made up and any similarity with reality is coincidence.

## Introduction 📋
Menu Splits have been around Glovo for quite a while now. A Menu Split is a delivery-only store, operated from the same kitchen and same products as the mother brand. The only difference is that a Menu Split is composed only of a part of the menu from the mother brand.

Unfortunately, due to the database structure in Glovo, we do not have an intuitive way to measure their performance. Therefore, we do not know if they are a concept in which we should keep investing or not. Luckily, we do have available a dataset where Menu Splits are linked to their Mother brands (restaurant which operates the Menu Split).

## Objective 🎯
You will be in charge of analyzing their performance with as much detail as you can and find the benefits or problems which Menu Splits have. Not only as an individual brand but also as an extra brand for the restaurant operating it.

## Key Points to Consider 🔑
- Menu splits are delivery-only brands which are operated in the same kitchen as their Mother brand.
- A Mother brand can have more than one Menu Split.
- There might be some inconsistencies in the data, we expect you to deal with those inconsistencies and specify how you handled them.

## Analysis Approach 📈
Open your mind: Think of all the ways you can evaluate a brand performance and know which impact is having for Glovo and also for the partner. This business case not only aims to understand your technical skills but also to evaluate your business skills, especially on which KPIs you evaluate the most and how you categorize the data and how deep you can dig with the data available.

### Pro Tips 💡
1. Mother brands are regular brands, which can be a good way to compare Menu Split performance to regular brands.
2. At Glovo we have always liked cohort analysis, since it makes data easier to contextualize. The first few weeks after launching are always tough.

## Presentation Requirements 📝
The presentation must contain a thorough analysis of how Menu Split performs and the impact they have for the partner operating them, as well as, for Glovo. Also a final conclusion about whether to know if we should keep launching them or not. It is important to understand the final goal of the analysis and to be capable of explaining how and why you analyze each part.
